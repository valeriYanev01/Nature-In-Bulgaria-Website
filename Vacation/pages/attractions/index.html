          Vitosha is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the
          symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous
          dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most
          frequently visited parts. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans. The mountain emerged as a result
          of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a
          series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by
          17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha
          is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as Cherni Vrah. The laccolithic
          domed form of Vitosha is a typical example. Bulgaria's longest cave – Duhlata, with a total length of 18,200
          m, is situated in Vitosha in the karstic region near the village of Bosnek. A meteorological station was built
          at the top in 1935, and is still operating. The station also serves as a rest shelter for hikers and is the
          headquarters for the mountain rescue team. Historical documents show that several centuries ago Vitosha
          mountain was still covered by the remains of the inaccessible "Great Bulgarian Forest" (Magna Silva
          Bulgarica). Today, the natural coniferous forests of Vitosha remain only in the reserve Bistrishko Branishte
          and around Zlatnite Mostove (The Golden Bridges). At a time when nature conservation ideas were a long way
          from the present understanding, some enlightened noblemen took the first step in 1934 by declaring 66 km² of
          Vitosha a nature park, hence Vitosha became the first park of this kind in the Balkans. During the following
          year, some of the early Bulgarian reserves, Bistrishko Branishte and Torfeno Branishte, were designated within
          its boundaries. The park boundaries fluctuated over many years and today it encompasses the entire mountain.
          It is the highest massif of Srednogorie mountain chain system, that includes also the mountains of Sredna gora
          range, Plana, Lyulin, Greben, Viskyar, etc. The Aleko area with the Aleko lodge in the middle Ecology Due to a
          great variability in elevation, a rich diversity of climates, flora and fauna can be found within the park.
          Research has revealed that on the comparatively small area of the mountain there are 1,500 species of higher
          plants, 500 species of fungi, 500 species of algae, 326 species of mosses, and 200 species of lichens. The
          forests are mainly composed of Norway spruce and Bulgarian fir, with some Macedonian pine, Scots pine, and at
          the tree-line, mountain pine, and mixed deciduous forest at lower altitudes, mainly beech, birch, aspen and
          alder.
